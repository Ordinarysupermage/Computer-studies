	<h3>Input Device</h3> 
	<p1> Input device is a devie that provides data and siganls to a processing unit. Input devices can provide signals such as mechanical or audio siganls. Examples for a Inpute deivce are things such as keyboards and mouse. Input devices are extremely inportant because they are the units that tell the computer what to do.
	</p1>

<div> 
 <h3>Output Device</h3>
	<p1>Devices such as monitors and speakers are examples of Out Put device. After the computer process signals and codes from Input devices, it gives out signals to out put devices. The out put devices than turn the signal in to physical, or other motions.

	<h3>Central Processing Unit(CPU)</h3>
	<p1>Central Processing Unit is alos known as CPU. CPU is a circuit that process instructions. It provides basic controlling, logic and Input/Output operations from a specific program.
	</p1>
</div>

<div> 
	<h3>Arthmetic Logic Unit(ALU)</h3>
	<p1>ALU is a combinational digital circuit that performs operations on integer binary numbers. It's a part of CPU and graphics processing units(GPU). ALU is very important because they are the building block and operation units of a CPU and GPU.

<div>
	<h3>Control Unit</h3>
	<p1>The Control Unit is a part of the CPU. It tells the computer memory, arithmetic logic unit and input and output devices how to respond to a specific instruction that have been sent to the CPU. It controls operations by providing timing and control signals.
	</p1>

	<h3>Random Acess Memory<h3>
	<p1>Random Acess Memory is also known as RAM which is a short term memory. It remembers progress that you are currently working on, but if the computer is turned off then the progress will be lost unless saved to a long term memory. RAM also requires a lot of power, for example if the computer is plugged into a power source but then unpluged, then the RAM memory might be lost.<p1>

<div>
	<h3>Optical Memory<h3>
	<p1>Optical Memory is any storage method that uses a laser to store and retrieve data from optical media. It reads digital binary data. For example the old floppy disks uses lazer to read the special dots stored on the disks.</p1>
</div>	

<div> 
	<h3>Magnetic Memory</h3>
	<p1>Magnetic Memory is also known as core memory. This type of memeory use rings of a hard magnetic material as tranformer of codes. Magnetic hysteresis allows each of the cores to remember a code, which is bursts of electrons. Each core stores one "bit" of information and can be magnetized in either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Each directions stands for 1s or 0s.</p1> 
</div>

<div>
	<h3>Flash Memory</h3> 
	<p1>Flash memory is an electronic non-volatile computer memory that is reprogramable. It's similar to a long term memory, but it can be electrically erased. The Flash Memory uses logic gates and circuits.Flash Memory is a type of floating-gate memory that was invented by Toshiba in 1980.</p1>
